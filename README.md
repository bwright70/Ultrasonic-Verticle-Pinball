## Basic Onshape Design 

### Description 

Just a rough draft of what we wanted the machine to look like. 

### Process

This was first on our to do list when we first planned out this project. We wanted to get some basic outlines and dementions in onshape so that we could start working on the specifics of other parts like the candy despensor. We made some intial drawings in a Jambord document and then moved on to Github where we designed the basic outline for our parts. Just dropping in a few blank slabs of acrilic with the right dimensions and pulling some more complicated parts from the parts library to make sure everything would fit.
